# Certificate Generation and Verification on Ethereum Blockchain

## Overview

This project demonstrates a backend application for generating and verifying certificates using the Ethereum blockchain. Built using Solidity, the smart contracts ensure that certificates are securely stored and can be verified by any party on the blockchain. The system leverages the immutability and transparency of blockchain technology to prevent certificate forgery and ensure trustworthiness.

## Features

- **Certificate Generation:** Authorized users (e.g., educational institutions) can generate certificates and store them on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Certificate Verification:** Any party can verify the authenticity of a certificate by querying the blockchain.
- **Decentralized Storage:** All certificates are stored on the blockchain, making them tamper-proof and easily verifiable.
- **Transparency and Security:** Blockchain's inherent properties ensure that once a certificate is issued, it cannot be altered or deleted.

## Technology Stack

- **Ethereum Blockchain**: The project is deployed on the Ethereum network.
- **Solidity**: The smart contract language used to create the certificate management system.
- **Web3.js**: To interact with the Ethereum blockchain from the backend.

## Smart Contract Overview

### Certificate Contract

The smart contract, written in Solidity, manages the creation and verification of certificates.

### Deployment

The smart contract should be deployed on the Ethereum network. Use tools like Truffle or Hardhat for development and deployment.

### Interaction with the Smart Contract

Interaction with the smart contract can be done via a backend application using the Web3.js library.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
- **Ethereum Wallet**: An Ethereum wallet like MetaMask is needed to interact with the blockchain.
- **Truffle/Hardhat**: For smart contract development and deployment.
- **Ganache** (for local development): A personal Ethereum blockchain for testing.
